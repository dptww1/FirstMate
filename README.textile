h1. FirstMate

FirstMate helps coordinate Napoleonic naval battle game using {Close Action}[http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3553/close-action],
produced by Clash of Arms games.

Close Action is most fun when played with a large number of players, preferably one player per ship. But each player adds coordination
head-aches for the referee, so some sort of automated management would be useful. That's where FirstMate comes in.  This code 
doesn't play the game, nor track ship positions (use Cyberboard for that).  Instead, it's goal is just to coordinate the numerous
messages that need to be sent to keep a CA game moving, and to standardize the order and gunnery reports that the players submit.

This is very much a work-in-progress, proof-of-concept kind of thing.  Plus it's a fun excuse to experiment with Rails.
