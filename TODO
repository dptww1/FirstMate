* General/System
** database.yml shouldn't be checked in (DUH)
** Pickle 
** Metric fu http://railscasts.com/episodes/166-metric-fu
** XML handling in controllers

* Features TO DO
** Generic phases per turn; info available public/private per turn/game; (deadline type is just a phase name)
** normalize Side1, Side2, ...
** Struck ships don't count against completion limits
** orders maybe should be nested route below squadronsships
** squadronsships should be nested route below game
** rewrite game.find_progress_counts to use AR
** CRUD/squadrons (some features written)
** default text for new orders (e.g. "SS:FS  S1:- S2:- S3:- S4:- M:- NOTES:")
** activate email icon as link to send email to person/side/squadron/game
*** must be logged in to send email, can only send to friendly ships
** ordering within squadrons (squadrons_ship.seq_num)
** Game DELETE link moved from games list to game show page

* Games 
*** views
**** index
***** Client-side table sorting
**** edit
***** deadline formatting is inconsistent between initial value and entered value
***** Any Time CSS formatting to improve looks http://www.ama3.com/anytime/
*** model
**** deleting game doesn't delete its squadrons (probably needs to continue on down the tree)

* Orders
*** controller 
**** needs before_filter, authenticate user in general

*** view
**** index
***** should obscure current turn's orders if no permissions (wrong side, not commander)
