* STORY

** GUEST USER EXPERIENCE

Andre is interested in Close Action and decides to check out FM.  He goes to the
website and sees the MAIN PAGE.

As Andre's not a logged-in user he has only anonymous access to the site.  He
sees a list of games in progress, and a list of completed games.

In Progress games look like: 
    Game Name | Turn XXX | Move Orders due Tue 2011-02-08 11:00 EST

Completed games look like: 
    Game Name | Turn XXX | Notes

He clicks on a game name, which takes him to the GAME PAGE.

The GAME PAGE shows a list of the ships involved in that particular game.

    Ship Name | Rating | Player Name

in two columns, one per side (e.g. British in column 1, French in column 2).  

The tables within the columns should be sortable, so all unassigned ships can
be grouped, or the ship names can be alphabetized.

Andre clicks on a ship name, which takes him to the SHIP PAGE.

The SHIP PAGE shows a turn-by-turn list of all the orders for that ship in
that game.

Andre clicks [Back] to go back to the GAME PAGE, then [Back] again to get to the
MAIN PAGE.

There's no way to start a game without registering, so Andre clicks "Register"
and signs up.  

** REGISTRATION PROCESS

[TODO: registration process]

** REGISTERED USER EXPERIENCE

Now that Andre's registered, the MAIN PAGE has two new sections, "My In Progress
Games" and "My Completed Games".  Both are currently empty.

The "Start a New Game" button is now available.  Andre clicks it and goes to 
the NEW GAME page.
